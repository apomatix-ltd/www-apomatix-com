[CTA – Book a demo] 

Internal controls determine the level of risk your organisation is exposed to. An efficient and effective set of internal controls reduces your risk burden and prevents a wide range of harmful outcomes (e.g. data breach, regulatory fines, etc). 

Yet many organizations have no real time view of the effectiveness of their internal controls. They are in the dark as to the level of risk they face. Apomatix's Internal Controls Management Software solution empowers you to seize back the initiative and simplify your internal control management process.

Track the implementation status of all controls in scope. Set target implementation dates and follow progress from start to finish.
