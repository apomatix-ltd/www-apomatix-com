Asset Management is an essential part of any Information Security Management System. It appears in a number of popular security standards, including ISO 27001 (Annex A.8) and CIS 20 (Controls 1 & 2). Despite this, many organisations manage their assets inefficiently using generic tools.   

Apomatix’s Asset Management Software helps you take your asset management process to the next level. Leave paper records behind and move to one dedicated software platform 

Headline: Centralise your Asset Management 

Move on from scattered word documents and excel spreadsheets. Apomatix’s Asset Management software allows you to centralise all your asset management activities.  

Quickly add, classify and categorise assets using preconfigured, but customisable, settings.  

Define asset relationships and hierarchies. 

Further segment work by associating assets with a given scope (e.g. IT Department, HR Department, etc), or with the business as a whole.  

Headline: Track your activity. 

Ensure that nothing gets missed. Track assets across their entire lifecycle, guaranteeing key milestones are always met.  

Assign owners to each asset to formally track and document who is responsible.  

Create tasks against each asset to manage any relevant work.  

Set formal review dates at critical points in the asset’s lifecycle (e.g. re-classification disposal, etc).  

Headline: Integrate with your risks and internal controls.  

Get a complete view. Understand the role your assets play in your risk management system.  

Associate assets with risks so you can more accurately assess the specific threats your organization faces.  

Apply internal controls to asset risks to reduce the impact and/or likelihood. 

View risks linked to specific assets using the dashboard, and drill down further with customizable reports.
